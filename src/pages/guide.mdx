## Create a Wordpress instance

[Log in to Saucer](/dashboard) using your GitHub account and click the **Create instance** button to configure a new Wordpress instance. Set your website title, and admin username and password. This will be the username/password combination that you'll use to log in to your Wordpress dashboard for the first time. You may also install some optional plugins and their GraphQL counterparts from this panel.

## Bootstrap a Gatsby website

Once your Wordpress instance is ready to use, you can start consuming its data in a static Gatsby website with little effort. First, open up a terminal window, create your project directory, and install some Node packages as dependencies:

```bash
mkdir my-project
cd my project
npm init -y # create a package.json
npm install gatsby react react-dom gatsby-source-graphql react-helmet gatsby-plugin-react-helmet # install dependencies
touch gatsby-config.js # create an empty config file
```

Next, create a Gatsby config file and configure a GraphQL source using your new Wordpress instance. Using the following example, replace `YOUR-INSTANCE-NAME` with the unique name given to your instance.

```js
// gatsby-config.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    'gatsby-plugin-react-helmet',
    {
      resolve: 'gatsby-source-graphql',
      options: {
        typeName: 'Wordpress',
        fieldName: 'wordpress',
        url: 'https://YOUR-INSTANCE-NAME.saucer.dev/graphql'
      }
    }
  ]
};
```

The `fieldName` option is important because you'll be making GraphQL queries against this exact name in the next step. We also include `gatsby-plugin-react-helmet` so that the HTML title and meta tags set by `react-helmet` (also in the next step) get statically rendered in production builds.

## Create a homepage

Let's build a homepage for your website that reads from the GraphQL source you just configured. We'll create a React component at `src/pages/index.js` that renders the website title and description; and lists your blog posts. The file should end up looking something like this:

```jsx
// src/pages/index.js
import React, {Fragment} from 'react';
import {Helmet} from 'react-helmet';
import {Link, graphql} from 'gatsby';

export default function Home(props) {
  // page queries make their results available on the `data` prop
  const {generalSettings, posts} = props.data.wordpress;
  const {title, description} = generalSettings;

  return (
    <Fragment>
      {/* use react-helmet to add a page title and description */}
      <Helmet>
        <title>{title}</title>
        <meta name="description" content={description} />
      </Helmet>

      {/* render the title and description in the page */}
      <h1>{title}</h1>
      <p>{description}</p>

      {/* loop through posts and render their title and excerpt */}
      {posts.nodes.map(post => (
        <div key={post.id}>
          <h3 style={{color: 'red'}}>
            <Link to={`/posts/${post.slug}`}>{post.title}</Link>
          </h3>
          <h5>Posted on {new Date(post.date).toLocaleDateString()}</h5>
          <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{__html: post.excerpt}} />
        </div>
      ))}
    </Fragment>
  );
}

// use a page query to retrieve data from your GraphQL source
export const pageQuery = graphql`
  {
    wordpress {
      generalSettings {
        title
        description
      }
      posts {
        nodes {
          id
          slug
          date
          title
          excerpt
        }
      }
    }
  }
`;
```

Type `npx gatsby develop` in your terminal to run your local development server and enjoy the fruits of your labor so far. ðŸ¤©

## Generate post pages

Now that you have an index page, it's time to create pages for each post. To do this, we'll use Gatsby's `createPages` API in a `gatsby-node.js` file.

```js
// gatsby-node.js
exports.createPages = async ({actions, graphql}) => {
  const data = await graphql(`
    {
      wordpress {
        posts {
          nodes {
            id
            slug
          }
        }
      }
    }
  `);
  
  const postTemplate = require.resolve('./src/components/post-template.js');
  data.wordpress.posts.nodes.forEach(post => {
    actions.createPage({
      // path below matches the path format in the posts list on the homepage
      path: `/posts/${post.slug}`,
      component: postTemplate,
      context: {
        id: post.id // for use in the post template's page query
      }
    })
  });
};
```

In the code sample above, we're doing three things to generate post pages:

1. Make a GraphQL query for the `id` and `slug` properties of each post
1. Resolve the path to your post template component (yet to be created)
1. Loop through posts and run `actions.createPage` for each, using `slug` to create the path, and passing `id` along to the template as context

The post template component will make a GraphQL query for an individual post, using a page query with the `id` property passed in as context. It will then render the title and content of the post on the page.

```jsx
// src/components/post-template.js
import React, {Fragment} from 'react';
import {Helmet} from 'react-helmet';
import {Link, graphql} from 'gatsby';

export default function PostTemplate(props) {
  const {title, content} = props.data.wordpress.post;
  return (
    <Fragment>
      <Helmet>
        <title>{title}</title>
      </Helmet>
      <Link to="/">Back to home</Link>
      <h1>{title}</h1>
      <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{__html: content}} />
    </Fragment>
  );
}

// properties that you set in a page's context are made available for use in
// page queries, such as $id in this case
export const pageQuery = graphql`
  query PostQuery($id: String) {
    wordpress {
      post(id: $id) {
        title
        content
      }
    }
  }
`;
```

Restart your development server with `npx gatsby develop` to see your new post pages. Now you can fine tune and style your site to your heart's content. Happy developing! ðŸš€

## Deploy with Netlify

Now that your site is built, you probably want to host it somewhere. [Netlify](https://netlify.com) offers free hosting and automated deploys for websites just like yours. Before going any further, make sure your work is commited to a GitHub repo. This is one of the ways that Netlify will refer to your working files and detect changes to trigger new deploys.

Once your project is on GitHub, [log in to Netlify](https://app.netlify.com) and follow the steps on screen to link your repo with a new Netlify site. If everything works, your site should begin building and will be deployed within a few minutes.

Any time you make a commit to your GitHub repo, Netlify will start a new build and deploy your updated code. This works great for website logic or styling changes, but what about when your Wordpress content changes?

## Trigger deploys when content changes

Every Saucer instance comes with [Gatsby Toolkit](https://github.com/staticfuse/gatsby-toolkit) installed. Gatsby Toolkit is a Wordpress plugin that triggers a Netlify deploy any time you publish new content (posts, pages, categories) or edit existing content. To configure Gatsby Toolkit, you need to create a Netlify build hook.

Go to the **Build & deploy** tab of your Netlify site settings and scroll down to the **Build hooks** section. Click the **Add build hook** button and give your hook a name, like "Wordpress".

Copy the build hook URL and paste it into the **Settings > Gatsby Toolkit** menu in your Wordpress dashboard. Now every time you add or edit content, a Netlify deploy will automatically be triggered.
